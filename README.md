# MERN Task Manager
## Description

A full-stack Task Management Application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). This application allows users to manage tasks efficiently by adding, editing, deleting, and viewing tasks. The frontend is built with React, and the backend is powered by Express and MongoDB for data storage. This project is a great starting point for anyone interested in full-stack development.




## Features

- Add Tasks: Users can create tasks and assign them titles and descriptions.
- Edit Tasks: Tasks can be updated with new information.
- Delete Tasks: Tasks can be removed from the list.
